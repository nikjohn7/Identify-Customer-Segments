# Identify Customer Segments


## Project Overview
In this project, I worked with real-life data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 


## What will I need to install?
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Sklearn / scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn (for data visualization)

### The Data

The dataset is large and hence has not been added to the repo. If you want access to the dataset, feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin via this [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilthomasjohn/). 

Following are the files in the dataset:

- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
